## PyCitySchools

As the Chief Data Scientist for the school district the primary responsibility is to assist the school board and mayor make strategic decisions regarding future school budgets and priorities.

This report analyses the district-wide standardized test results for student's math and reading scores, as well as various information on the schools they attend. The information has been grouped to showcase obvious trends in school performance.

The final report also includes each of the following using Pandas and Jupyter notebook to write the code and create data frames:

### District Summary

* A high level snapshot (in table form) of the district's key metrics, including:
  * Total Schools
  * Total Students
  * Total Budget
  * Average Math Score
  * Average Reading Score
  * % Passing Math (The percentage of students that passed math.)
  * % Passing Reading (The percentage of students that passed reading.)
  * % Overall Passing (The percentage of students that passed math **and** reading.)

### School Summary

* An overview table that summarizes key metrics about each school, including:
  * School Name
  * School Type
  * Total Students
  * Total School Budget
  * Per Student Budget
  * Average Math Score
  * Average Reading Score
  * % Passing Math (The percentage of students that passed math.)
  * % Passing Reading (The percentage of students that passed reading.)
  * % Overall Passing (The percentage of students that passed math **and** reading.)

### Top Performing Schools (By % Overall Passing)

* A table that highlights the top 5 performing schools based on the percentage of overall passing. Including:
  * School Name
  * School Type
  * Total Students
  * Total School Budget
  * Per Student Budget
  * Average Math Score
  * Average Reading Score
  * % Passing Math (The percentage of students that passed math.)
  * % Passing Reading (The percentage of students that passed reading.)
  * % Overall Passing (The percentage of students that passed math **and** reading.)

### Bottom Performing Schools (By % Overall Passing)

* A table that highlights the bottom 5 performing schools based the percentage of overall passing. Including all the same metrics as above.

### Math Scores by Grade\*\*

* A table that lists the average Math Score for students of each grade level (9th, 10th, 11th, 12th) at each school.

### Reading Scores by Grade

* A table that lists the average Reading Score for students of each grade level (9th, 10th, 11th, 12th) at each school.

### Scores by School Spending

* A table that breaks down school performances based on average Spending Ranges (Per Student). Four reasonable bins have been created to group school spending. The table includes each of the following:
  * Average Math Score
  * Average Reading Score
  * % Passing Math (The percentage of students that passed math.)
  * % Passing Reading (The percentage of students that passed reading.)
  * % Overall Passing (The percentage of students that passed math **and** reading.)

### Scores by School Size

* A table that breaks down by grouping schools based on a reasonable approximation of school size (Small, Medium, Large).

### Scores by School Type

* A table that breaks down by grouping schools based on school type (Charter vs. District).

### Observation Summary

* From the above analysis, the following conclusions have been noted. 

In summary, out of the 15 schools, Cabrera High which is a Charter school with 1858 students has the highest overall passing percentage scored at 91.33% with a spending range of less than $584 per student. 

In conclusion, Schools with higher spending averages have a lower overall passing rate compare to medium and small schools which have a higher overall passing rate. It is also evident Charter schools have a higher overall passing rate than district schools
